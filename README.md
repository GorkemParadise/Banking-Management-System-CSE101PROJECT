# 🌐 Banking Management System 🏦

This is a terminal-based Banking Management System created for my 2026 FALL CSE101 lab project.
The goal of this project is to build a simple but realistic banking application that works completely in the terminal. It allows users to register, login, manage their money, and view their transaction history. 
Admins can also see system reports and manage settings.
