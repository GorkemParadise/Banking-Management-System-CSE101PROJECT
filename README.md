# 🌐 Banking Management System 🏦

This is a terminal-based Banking Management System created for my 2025 FALL CSE101 lab project.
The goal of this project is to build a simple but realistic banking application that works completely in the terminal. It allows users to register, login, manage their money, and view their transaction history. 
Admins can also see system reports and manage settings.

-📊 Transaction history and reports saved in JSON files
-🔐 Account security, input validation, and error handling
-🛠️ Admin dashboard for viewing all users and bank statistics
-💾 Automatic backups for safe data storage

-Basics of object-oriented programming
-Building a full working application in the terminal
